I work as a Cloud Security Architect within financial services in New York City. Through my years of experience I've been working with private, hybrid and public cloud hosted infrastructure. The past years has been mostly about cybersecurity, cloud and culture. I like PowerShell and am a learner of Python. I am public speaker and have presented at multiple infrastructure and security conferences across Europe.
