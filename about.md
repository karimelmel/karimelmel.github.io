Now I am part of building a boutique consultancy offering superior advisory in cyber security, especially the segment of cloud security.

Through my years of experience I’ve been working with private, hybrid and public cloud hosted infrastructure. The past years has been all about cybersecurity, cloud and strategy. I am a public speaker and have presented at multiple infrastructure and security conferences across Europe, I also did a keynote for [Paranoia](https://www.paranoia.watchcom.no/) conference. 

Besides work I love exercise, meditation, reading books and traveling. I also spend my free time on a cyber security podcast in Norwegian.
