Two years ago I went from working with Azure to AWS, back then I didn't see myself becoming engaged in the AWS Security Community but I've later learned that my passion for security and being part of communities goes beyond specific technologies. 

I'm excited to announce that I've been accepted as part of the AWS Commununity Builders program that will allow me to work closer with the people at Amazon Web Services. I am glad to see that AWS supports the community and excited for the opportunities this may provide. I want to be part of and hopefully make an impact on the cybersecurity scene in my local community, I believe this program will support this objective.

I will remain neutral when covering cloud security topics, regardless of which company it may involve.
