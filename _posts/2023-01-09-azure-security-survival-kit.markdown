# Background
Inspired by the work done by [Victor Grenu](https://zoph.io/) on the project [AWS Security Survival Kit](https://github.com/zoph-io/aws-security-survival-kit) we decided to create a similar project for Microsoft Azure.

The project is built using Azure Bicep with modules. The author had little to no previous experience with Azure Bicep prior to this project.

## Purpose
We want to give anyone with an Azure subscription the ability to centralize logs and to detect a bare minimum of potential threats in Microsoft Azure and to provide the community with a simple framework that allows to further expand detections without investing a lot of time.
